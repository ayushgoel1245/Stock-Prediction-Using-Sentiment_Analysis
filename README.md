# Stock Price Prediction Using Sentiment_Analysis Time Series Algorithms

This project predicts stock prices using machine learning algorithms, specifically **LSTM**, **Prophet**, and **ETS**. It utilizes historical stock price data and sentiment analysis to enhance prediction accuracy.
---

## Features
- Predict stock prices using time series models.
- Analyze sentiment from news or social media for enhanced predictions.
- Visualize predictions and trends with graphs.
---

## Dataset
- **Stock Data:** Historical stock price data (e.g., Tesla, Netflix).
- **Sentiment Data:** Textual data (e.g., tweets, headlines) for sentiment analysis.
---

## Algorithms Used
1. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):**
   - Deep learning model for time-series forecasting.
2. **Facebook Prophet:**
   - Flexible forecasting model for time-series data.
3. **Exponential Smoothing (ETS):**
   - Statistical time series model for trend and seasonality.
